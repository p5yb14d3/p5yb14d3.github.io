    <p>Hello World from Pelican!</p>
<p>It was UW-Madison's spring break this past week, so I finally had some time to see family, friends, and improve my programming chops--something I desperately needed to do but haven't had nearly enough time for because of my college classes. Here are a few things I finished in the past 5 days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reversr [code] - Since I've worked primarily with full-stack web frameworks, i.e. Django and Rails, I wanted to give their micro-sized counterparts, Flask and Sinatra, a fair shot. I also needed a reason to learn the Web Audio API. So I made an app with both frameworks1 that just records and plays back audio (in reverse, of course) in a browser.2</p>
<p>Experimenting with OpenCV and SimpleCV - Tracking mice and recording their huddling behavior.</p>
<p>My first phylogenetic analysis - Tarsiers are the cutest evolutionary mystery.</p>
<p>Online classes - Finished about a third of Design of Computer Programs (Udacity) and the first week of Functional Programming in Scala (Coursera). Both Norvig and Odersky offer great introductions to functional programming.</p>
<p>This website - Thanks to Jekyll Bootstrap and Github Pages, this was amazingly simple.</p>
<p>Similar in spirit to this, except that my purpose was solely to teach myself rather than provide good examples of the different languages. ?</p>
<p>I've found that one of the most efficient ways for me to start learning a new language/framework/etc. is to build a small, single-purpose app using it. I don't mean an app from a tutorial (e.g. the ubiquitous 20-minute blog) but an app that I actually find interesting. The app can be embarrassingly small and messy, as Reversr was, and I still end up learning more in less time than it takes for to find &quot;the best tutorial for learning X&quot; on Google. ?</p>
</blockquote>
